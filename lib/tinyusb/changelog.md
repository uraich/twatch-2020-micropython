First release, device stack works great, host stack works but still need improvement. 
- Special thanks to @adafruit team, especially @tannewt to help out immensely to rework device stack: simplify osal & control transfer, adding SAMD21/SAMD51 ports, writing porting docs, adding MIDI class support etc... 
- Thanks to @cr1901 for adding STM32F4 port.
- Thanks to @PTS93 and @todbot for HID raw API
